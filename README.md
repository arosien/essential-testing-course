# Essential Testing

a.k.a., **Writing Programs That Write Tests: Better Testing With ScalaCheck**.

## Course

The course materials are written using [mdoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc/).
To generate the course docs, run:

```
$ sbt mdoc
```

and the machine-checked documentation will be written to `target/mdoc`.


## Exercises

Exercises for the course are currently in two places:

* Most are in `src/test/scala`.
* The extended exercise, testing a "TODO" web application, is under the `todo` sub-project.
